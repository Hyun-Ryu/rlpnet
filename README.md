### [Paper]()
Official source codes for "RLP-Net: A Recursive Light Propagation Network for 3-D Virtual Refocusing", MICCAI 2021.

We propose a recursive light propagation network (RLP-Net) that infers the 3-D volume from two adjacent 2-D wide-field fluorescence images via virtual refocusing.
Specifically, we propose a recursive inference scheme in which the network progressively predicts the subsequent planes along the axial direction. 
This recursive inference scheme reflects that the law of physics for the light propagation remains spatially invariant and therefore a fixed function (i.e., a neural network) for a short distance light propagation can be recursively applied for a longer distance light propagation.
